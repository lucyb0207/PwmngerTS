# PwmngerTS 🔐

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This project is experimental and has not undergone a formal security audit. Do not use it to store highly sensitive passwords yet.

**An open-source, zero-knowledge, cross-platform password manager built with TypeScript and Next.js**

PwmngerTS is a client-side encrypted password manager designed to handle secrets across web and browser extension platforms. All encryption happens **locally on the user's device** — the server never sees plaintext passwords or master keys.

> Inspired by zero-knowledge architectures like Bitwarden, but built for learning, extensibility, and open collaboration.

## ✨ Features (v2.0.0)

- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Design:** Powered by client-side encryption (Web Crypto API + Argon2id).
- 🎨 **Unified Next.js App:** A single, high-performance App Router codebase for the vault and API.
- 🧩 **Chrome Extension:** Secure browser integration with robust error handling and cloud sync.
- 🛡️ **Advanced MFA:** Support for both **TOTP (2FA)** and **WebAuthn (Passkeys/Security Keys)**.
- 🆘 **Account Recovery:** Secure vault restoration via an Emergency Recovery Kit if you lose your password.
- 🔑 **Master Password Rotation:** Securely change your password with automatic **KDF Salt Rotation**.
- ☁️ **Seamless Sync:** Robust encrypted blob synchronization with conflict resolution.
- 📂 **Organization:** Manage entries with folders and a powerful search interface.

    Client[Client Device] -->|Encrypted Blob| NextJS[Next.js API Routes]
    Client -->|Argon2id Hash + Salt| NextJS
    NextJS -->|ORM| Prisma[Prisma Client]
    Prisma -->|Storage| DB[(PostgreSQL)]
```

**Security Guarantees:**
- Backend **NEVER** sees plaintext data.
- Master Password **NEVER** leaves the client (Argon2id KDF).
- Data is encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**.
- Dual-layer authentication using JWT (HTTP-only Cookies + Authorization Headers).
